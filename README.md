# Feasbility_Analysis_For_Wave_Energy_At_California_Coast
Developed a low-cost inflatable wave energy converter to harness California’s wave potential. Through iterative prototyping and ML-based resource assessment, the project achieved 4× higher energy capture while reducing cost and complexity, highlighting inflatable WECs as a scalable renewable energy solution.
